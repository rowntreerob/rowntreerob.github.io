ls=3D"56" rows=3D"20">From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein s=
how. On Friday, May 10th, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution sayin=
g Palestinians qualify for full member status at the UN. In the end, the vo=
te was overwhelming. In favor, 143, against 9, abstentions, 25. This was ne=
w.

The General Assembly had never voted for that before. But they did so now i=
n overwhelming numbers. The final vote was a 143 to 9. Israel voted against=
 it, so did the United States. Now, to make Palestinians, to make Palestine=
 a full member of the UN, would take a Security Council approval.

The US would veto that. Our position is in a Palestinian state should only =
emerge through negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. But the vote=
 itself was a sign of the chasm that is opening between not only Israel and=
 the UN, but America too. Israelis have long felt the UN is biased against =
them. In 1975, the UN voted to declare Zionism a form of racism.

They repealed that in 1991. From 2015 to 2022, the UN General Assembly adop=
ted a 140 resolutions on Israel. Over that same period, it passed 6 to 8 re=
solutions on all other countries combined. At the same time, the UN was ins=
trumental in the creation of Israel. Voting to partition the land of histor=
ic Palestine between Jews and Palestinians, and giving a majority of it to =
Jews.

Palestinians feel the UN in particular and international law in general has=
 been a procession of false promises. Where is their state, their self dete=
rmination? Where is a right of return for their displaced? What have all th=
ese resolutions and condemnations amounted to? Aza Bali is a professor at Y=
ale Law School who specializes in international law.

And I want to have Iran to trace a deeper question here too. One that stret=
ches beyond Israel and Gaza to Russia, Ukraine, and really the whole world.=
 What is international law actually for? As always, my email is recclianceh=
ow@nytimes.com. Aza Bali, welcome to the show.

Thank you for having me. So I think the way we normally think about laws is=
 that they're rules where if you break them, some kind of external actor co=
mes in to enforce a punishment, right? Maybe a sanction, maybe imprisonment=
. With that definition, is international law actually made up of laws? It i=
s made up of laws, and it sort of depends on where you sit.

So if we take an average sized country with an average military capacity an=
d an average economy, it might be very much deterred just by the presence o=
f the rules themselves from doing things that it could reasonably anticipat=
e would be subject to punishment under the rules, like sanctions or punishm=
ent like international adjudication. And it would depend a little bit what =
kind of violation it was and whose interests were at stake. But there are m=
any, many contexts in international law where it operates just the same way=
 that you expected to operate in a domestic legal system. We are thinking a=
bout international law from the perspective of sitting in the United States=
, a country that is the author of most of the rules, a rule maker, and not =
very often a rule taker, in part because it's by far the most powerful stat=
e in the international system. And we tend to project from that experience =
of understanding international law in, let's say, an a la carte manner to h=
ow all states in the international system might regard international law, b=
ut that's wrong.

I think that makes sense to me, but but one of the things I was looking at =
before we talked was what, since roughly 2000, have been the conflicts with=
 the the most terrible casualty counts? And when you look at that, you actu=
ally do see a lot of countries that are not hugely powerful international a=
ctors. I mean, you see Syria on there, you see, Yemen, you know, in the the=
 Yemen civil war, You see, Ethiopia and Eritrea. And all of these, and some=
 of them in particular, have had terrible atrocities associated with them. =
But the fact that the the perpetrators weren't particularly powerful did no=
t seem to create some opening by which the international community could st=
op the bloodletting.

Yeah. In the two specific examples you just gave that you began with in Syr=
ia and Yemen, the reason for this is because smaller or less powerful actor=
s can seek great power patrons in the international system, and those very =
powerful states can disable mechanisms of enforcement and accountability. S=
o in the case of Syria, it has cultivated a relationship with Russia, and R=
ussia has effectively used its veto power at the Security Council to shield=
 Syria from various forms of accountability that were very much on the tabl=
e. With respect to Yemen, the source of impunity has been the United States=
, and Saudi Arabia has been able to wield its own influence backed by the U=
nited States at the UN through a variety of backroom negotiations and open =
threats. So the cases you began with are cases where great powers stopped a=
ccountability from occurring through their veto and the security council an=
d other means.

That still leaves the other example you gave, which is Eritrea and Ethiopia=
. And I would add to that one more, which is the conflict that has consumed=
 the great lakes region in Africa since the late 19 nineties, where you've =
had millions of people displaced, millions of people killed and injured, an=
d essentially very little by way of international intervention. These are c=
ases where no great power is interested and is willing to generate the poli=
tical will to engage the institutional accountability mechanisms that exist=
 because there isn't, for example, a domestic audience cost. There isn't an=
 outcry domestically over that particular conflict in the Great Lakes regio=
n, DRC example that I gave you, there's no comparison between the level of =
attention and scrutiny given by the American public to conflicts that are o=
ccurring in Europe or in the Middle East, and those that are occurring in p=
arts of Africa where the United States is not historically deeply implicate=
d or engaged. So what I hear you saying here in in different directions, is=
 it for international law, like for other kinds of law, power really matter=
s?

Yeah. And if you would let me indulge in just one more example. In the cont=
ext of the 19 nineties when the United States was by far the most powerful =
state in the international system, an uncontested sort of unipolar moment, =
there were 2 major crises that involved clear evidence of crimes against hu=
manity, possibly genocidal crimes and violence. 1 was in Yugoslavia, and th=
e other one was in Rwanda. And there was enormous international attention t=
o these contexts.

And yet there was still a reluctance to do the first thing that internation=
al law might have required, which is to trigger measures through the UN Sec=
urity Council that would wield international power to get the violence to s=
top. And there were constant calls for this. But from the United States per=
spective, in painful punishing experience in Somalia earlier in the 19 nine=
ties, had yielded the lesson that we will not be implicated in judgments by=
 the security council suggesting that such an obligation might exist, for e=
xample, by characterizing the conflict in Rwanda as a genocide, we will not=
 allow this because this will drag us into engagements that we do not wish =
to be part of. Eventually, of course, because the Yugoslav conflict was unf=
olding on European soil, eventually, you did have a direct intervention, bu=
t it took a very long time. And so that's another example of a place, it's =
sort of in between, where international law is definitely being used.

It's shaping the responses of actors, but it's being deployed in a way that=
 defers the urgency of the moment and allows bloodletting to continue. Befo=
re we get into the conflict, we're we're actually really here to talk about=
, I guess I wanna ask a more personal question of you, which is, this seems=
 from everything you are describing here to be an incredibly frustrating wo=
rld to work in. I know a number of international lawyers. I know people who=
 care deeply about international law and they are unerringly some of the mo=
st idealistic, most justice oriented people I have ever met. And yet what w=
e're describing here, what you're describing here is a world where powerful=
 states decide whether enforcement actions will be taken, where power decid=
es whether the law will apply at all, where the relevant body of the UN tha=
t decides on security actions is dominated by a small number of of very pow=
erful players wielding vetoes.

How do you balance the sort of belief in the laws as written and your sort =
of recognition of the way that practical politics and and power end up shap=
ing and warping their application. So the international peace and security =
order that we have emerged out of the 2nd World War, which resulted in the =
deaths of at least 30,000,000 civilians, which caused untold damage the wor=
ld over, although we tend in the United States to focus exclusively on the =
European theater. So the architecture that was established for the internat=
ional legal order in the aftermath of the 2nd World War prioritized peace o=
ver justice without any doubt in my view. The nations were united. The big =
five, China, Russia, Britain, France, and the United States led the peoples=
 of the world as they launched a rule of international law and a bill of hu=
man rights.

A rule of law they believed no nation, large or small, would dare defy. The=
 architecture of the United Nations security order gives asymmetric power t=
o the victors of the 2nd World War that were also assessed at that time to =
be the most powerful states in the international system, states that now ha=
ve nuclear weapons. Any war between those 5 states threatens planetary exti=
nction, and as a result, must at all cost be avoided. The architecture of t=
he UN endows them with this asymmetric power as a mechanism to keep them in=
side of the institution, negotiating the differences amongst them, rather t=
han resorting to extra diplomatic, extra political means to resolve their c=
onflicts. Now imagine a universe in which the great majority of countries a=
gree that the circumstances in Israel Palestine represent a threat to inter=
national peace and security and require imperatively international interven=
tion, the United States would interpret such an intervention as a direct th=
reat to one of its most core interests of enormous consequence.

And so immediately, you would be in a situation in which one nuclear power =
would be on one side of the equation, and arguably, 1 or more nuclear power=
s would be on the other side of a conflict. There is a real risk that any n=
umber of geopolitical zones of conflict, including Israel, Palestine, inclu=
ding the Middle East, could become the site of a metastasizing, a globalizi=
ng conflict in which one or more of these nuclear states is ranged against =
the other. But the institutional design of the United Nations system is int=
ended to prevent that by enabling each of these powers to paralyze any acti=
on, when one of these great powers understands its interests to be threaten=
ed. That's the design of the system. International law, though, has other c=
haracteristics too.

For one thing, it is a recognition of the sovereign equality of all states =
regardless of their ability to defend their borders militarily. So it's a s=
ystem that is a de jure matter, recognizes equality amongst fundamentally u=
nequal units in the international system and afford some possibility for sm=
aller states to protect their own independence using a normative language i=
n which all actors recognized as states in the international system have a =
shared vocabulary. That's an incredibly valuable possibility. It's a langua=
ge that makes it possible to make normative claims on the powerful and to l=
imit the degree to which they exercise their power in ways that are deeply =
compromising of the interests of states that are far weaker. So the basic d=
ecision made to build an international institutional architecture that reco=
gnizes those asymmetries of power and keeps those countries in even at the =
price of paralyzing the security order in circumstances where they believe =
their interests are at stake, is a decision to prioritize the avoidance of =
a third world war over justice as part of the actual internal institutional=
 structure of international law itself.

You've said that the creation of the state of Israel and the creation of th=
e of international law as we know it today are are interwoven. How so? So o=
ne of the things that the League of Nations did after World War 1 was overs=
ee the territories of collapsed empires that were defeated in the course of=
 the First World War and whose territories were now no longer under imperia=
l dominion. On the land empire of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, th=
e territories were not deemed capable of self government and were placed in=
stead under mandates, a kind of trusteeship, in the hands of colonial power=
s. One of those was the Palestine mandate, And it was bequeathed to Britain=
 to oversee as a mandate that was supposed to enable the self determination=
 of the people on that territory.

There were a range of events for 2 decades as the British maintained this m=
andate authority in which you had increasing immigration of Jews from Europ=
e and elsewhere to Palestine as part of their goal to establish a state on =
the Palestinian territory that would realize the ambitions of the Zionist m=
ovement, which was born in Europe in the 19th century. And the British auth=
orities were extremely supportive of the goal of Jewish communities to esta=
blish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. It was something that was conceived o=
f as a solution to an ongoing problem of Europe, which was the kind of ragi=
ng antisemitism and the violence that came with it that culminated horrific=
ally in the Shoah in the 2nd world war, but of course had punctuated Europe=
an history for centuries before that with pogroms and persecution across th=
e continent. And then of course, you had the indigenous Arab population of =
Palestine that were seeking self determination and independence as were the=
 Arab populations of the other mandates, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etcetera. =
And so, of course, this was producing intercommunal clashes because you now=
 had 2 communities that were seeking to engage in self determination on one=
 land.

And so this conflict raged for 2 decades. And at the end of the second Worl=
d War, the British, basically having difficulty maintaining imperial contro=
l as a general matter, turned its mandate in Palestine over to the newly fo=
rmed United Nations and was asked to make a judgment about what should be d=
one about these competing ambitions for a homeland. At a special session, t=
he general assembly of the United The judgment that the United Nations made=
 was that the land would be partitioned between the Jewish community, which=
 would get roughly 55% of the land, and the Arab community, which would get=
 roughly 45% of the land. The Palestinians of the territory were accorded l=
ess than half of the territory that had been part of the mandate. They obje=
cted to this.

They also constituted a very, very large majority on that territory at the =
time. But the Arab rejection led to a war. And in that war, the Jewish forc=
es gained a larger proportion of the territory even than had been assigned =
to them in the partition, leaving 22% of the territory under Arab control a=
nd the remainder under Jewish control. Israel was admitted to membership in=
 the United Nations, and her flag was raised at Lake Success. Again, the Un=
ited Nations had through peaceful mediation resolved an international dispu=
te, which had been a threat to world peace.

So that's as of 1949. But in the following 2 decades, the UN presided over =
a much, much wider scale decolonization of territories that had been coloni=
al possessions of Britain and France and other European powers across the M=
iddle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. And this enormous wave of decoloniza=
tion brought dozens of new countries into the United Nations, newly indepen=
dent countries. All of whom were highly committed to a model of decolonizat=
ion that enabled populations under colonial rule to achieve self determinat=
ion. So one thing I think this gets at is the way in which there are these =
two narratives that sit alongside each other about the foundation of the St=
ate of Israel and the sort of world we now inhabit around that, which is, o=
ne is that it was an act of the United Nations, right?

It was, there was a piece of paper, there was a partition plan, and another=
 is that the UN was a bit of a sideshow and there was a war and that sort o=
f understanding Israel and, for that matter, Palestine and Palestinians as =
constructs of international law has both always been tempting because inter=
national law has always been right there, but has actually been wrong becau=
se in the end, the UN did not send in peacekeepers or soldiers to enforce i=
ts own partition. It did not send in people to create its own preferred out=
come. And so there's been this tendency to look outside of the conflict for=
 this arbitrating authority of the UN that has always been right there alon=
gside the conflict and still is, but has never actually been able to manage=
 or effectively structure it. How do you think about the the way these sort=
 of two tracks of interpretation have evolved alongside each other? So I th=
ink that the second track that you describe, which just views the creation =
of the state of Israel as a fact of war, is problematic for a couple of rea=
sons.

The first is that it doesn't ask a set of questions that are the predicate =
to that war being possible. How was it that there was an idea that an Israe=
li state would emerge on a mandate from the Ottoman Empire that was called =
the Palestine mandate for the population that was on that territory at the =
time of the end of the First World War. That too was an instrument of inter=
national law. The mandates were created as a consequence of the Versailles =
Peace Treaty, and the British exercised its power as a matter of internatio=
nal law over Palestine. And, of course, many would argue, violated the term=
s of a mandate by enabling a kind of pattern of immigration and demographic=
 change, along with commitments, political and legal, to another community =
to achieve self determination on that same territory.

And this connects to the ways in which international law itself has long be=
en, prior to World War 2 and since, a system of rules that essentially have=
 facilitated European, let's say now Western or Global North control over s=
lots of territory that were defined lawfully as colonies. So the thing you'=
ll hear from Israelis on this is they feel the UN is biased against them. Y=
ou'll hear that from 2015 to 2020 2, the UN General Assembly adopted a 140 =
resolutions on Israel. It adopted 68 resolutions on all other countries com=
bined, even though this is a period when there was a lot of war, a lot of a=
trocity, a lot of human rights abuses in places like Syria and and Yemen. S=
o there is a specific level of interest in in Israel and the Palestinians.

That I think if you're just looking at, let's say, casualty counts of of di=
fferent wars and conflicts, you wouldn't be able to predict. So it's the on=
ly territory that had been slated to be decolonized at the creation of the =
United Nations that it inherited from that previous system that has not bee=
n decolonized. It is not disproportionate to the attention that was paid to=
 apartheid South Africa where the territory continued to be under white min=
ority rule. For decades in the United Nations, these two challenges were un=
derstood as ongoing examples of incomplete decolonization that continued lo=
ng after the rest of the world had been fully decolonized. At the beginning=
 of 19 nineties, there was an expectation, globally, that both of these rem=
aining dossiers of incomplete decolonization were on the cusp of being reso=
lved.

One of them because of the transition within South Africa to a post aparthe=
id constitutional regime, and the other because of the Oslo peace process a=
nd the imminent possibility of the emergence of a Palestinian state. In the=
 context of Israel Palestine, the 2 state solution did not come to fruition=
. And as a consequence, now, Palestine remains the one instance that goes r=
ight back to the founding of the United Nations of an example that a majori=
ty of states at the UN continue to interpret through the lens of incomplete=
 decolonization. So from the US perspective, decolonization's over. It was =
a good thing.

And now we're in this post cold war order. But from the perspective of the =
world that was subject to colonial dominion, the question of decolonization=
 remains very live and the continuities between the experience quite recent=
, I would add, historical experience of their nations and the current scene=
s that are emanating out of Israel Palestine makes this an ongoing issue of=
 concern for them, if only for symbolic reasons and if only to a limited ex=
tent. So voting on UN General Assembly resolutions is not exactly the same =
as having serious skin in the game. But those 143 states in the internation=
al system understand the Palestinians as entitled to self determination and=
 a state. 50 countries in the world don't recognize Palestinian statehood, =
and there's an enormous overlap between those 50 countries and the former c=
olonial powers in the international system.

And so in that circumstance, I think you can see why it is that what you're=
 describing as disproportionate attention is actually attention to the one =
case that continues to reflect this long standing grievance of the global s=
outh over the role that international has played in enabling subordination.=
 The view I often hear from Israelis about this is that they feel there is =
something unusual about the belief that Israel itself is unusual. And it's =
an attack they often lob specifically at the United States, which is itself=
 a nation that was settled, settled with enormous violence to it. There is =
a lot of blood in the founding and blood in the the early years of the coun=
try. And that at some point, that is no longer a question.

Right? There isn't an effort anywhere to sort of say, should the US continu=
e to exist? And and to Israelis, there are many countries that that look li=
ke that, that their foundations have a war in them, their foundations have =
an expulsion in them, but that country is now kind of accepted as just a co=
untry, not sort of an open case file. Whereas Israel, they feel like there =
is somehow softer clay around them than other countries that don't look all=
 that different in their origins. Do you think there's validity to that fee=
ling?

And if so, does it rules have changed. So it's quite true that Israel emerg=
es after the rules have changed. So it's quite true that the United States =
was founded in a very similar fashion with expropriation of its lands, ensl=
avement of peoples, transatlantic slave trade, etcetera. There's nothing to=
 celebrate about the origin story of the United States from that perspectiv=
e as a matter of international law, except that at the time that all of tha=
t happened, there weren't clear laws that excluded that. In fact, quite the=
 opposite, as I mentioned, international law facilitated colonial conquest =
of non European lands and territories and offered a set of justificatory fr=
ameworks for enabling that.

So first of all, there was already international law applicable that treate=
d Palestinians differently than indigenous populations of earlier centuries=
. As a consequence of the end of the First World War and the creation of th=
e League of Nations, Palestinians had already been recognized as a people w=
ith a legitimate right of self determination subject to a mandate that was =
understood as a trust in order for them to have their welfare preserved by,=
 I mean, however, cynically by a colonial power until such time as they cou=
ld exercise their right of self government. And secondly, following the end=
 of the 2nd World War, there were new rules about the conduct of war and th=
e protection of refugees. So it was against that backdrop that Israel came =
into existence. And it's less that it's considered a state unlike all other=
 states, and it's not an incomplete file as such just on the Israeli side.

It's rather the idea that today, you have 14,000,000 people on this territo=
ry. Half of them were recognized as having their own right of self determin=
ation, and that has been frustrated. The other half has achieved its right =
of self determination. So Israel has created a state that is an expression =
of the recognized right of self determination of the Jewish people, but is =
continually behaving in ways that essentially deny Palestinians the ability=
 to achieve the same. All of those efforts that you described of external a=
ctors to impose solutions of one kind or another, whether they be unilatera=
lly the British or the Americans or the United Nations as an international =
organization.

One thing they run up against is that there are actually 2 communities on t=
he ground whose preferences need to be taken into account. One of them is a=
symmetrically more powerful than the other. Each of the rounds that you des=
cribed or that we've discussed so far have greatly favored the Israeli side=
 in one way or another. The least example of that is the UN partition plan.=
 All subsequent plans have enabled Israel to retain far larger slots of ter=
ritory.

Territory acquired by use of force in a time when international law prohibi=
ts the acquisition of territory through the use of force. So these agreemen=
ts, these externally backed agreements have systematically favored the more=
 powerful side, and the inconvenient reality on the ground is that there ar=
e 2 populations of equal size on the territory, 7,000,000 Palestinians, 7,0=
00,000 Jewish citizens of Israel, and it has proven impossible to force thr=
ough external pressure or by dent of arms, Palestinians to simply accept th=
eir subordination as a legal matter and so you have an ongoing conflict. Le=
t me pull us into the present here and look at another body of internationa=
l law, which is the international laws around war and conflict. And let me =
begin on the part that I think people are talking less about right now, whi=
ch is that on 10/7, you have Hamas fighters cross into Israel. They kill ar=
ound 1200 people, most of them civilians.

They take 100 of hostages, many of them civilians. What is international la=
w to say about that? So they clearly violated the laws of war by first deli=
berately targeting civilians, secondly, taking civilians hostage, which is =
also impermissible, and then ongoing indiscriminate rocket fire is another =
source of violation. So there's undoubtedly war crimes committed by, you kn=
ow, armed Palestinian factions, including Hamas on October 7th. If Israel w=
anted to rely on an international law here as both a matter of defense and =
a matter of justice, what would it have said or done?

So it had a number of potential options. It could have engaged in a police =
action in Gaza seeking to apprehend individuals that they held responsible =
for the October 7th attacks. It would probably have begun with investigatio=
n on Israeli territory of who actually was responsible for taking the indiv=
iduals that had been captured alive on Israeli territory, interrogating the=
m, and then seeking to gain access to or jurisdiction over those that were =
held responsible. It could have engaged in a much narrower set of engagemen=
ts attempting to target facilities that made it possible for armed actors t=
o cross the border in the way it had. And primarily, it could have shored u=
p its own defenses because the conditions that enabled the October 7th atta=
ck to occur was not some new unexpected capacity on the part of armed actor=
s that represent an ongoing existential threat to Israel, but rather a fail=
ure to maintain basic defenses at the border with Gaza.

Israel has responded with the view that Hamas is a kind of organized fighti=
ng force that cannot be allowed to continue to exist as any kind of fightin=
g force. That as long as Hamas exists as a structure, it will continue plan=
ning and and using creative means to try to figure out how to how to strike=
 at Israel's weaknesses. And so that they need to destroy Hamas. They can't=
 just treat it as something where a couple people committed a crime. The th=
ing that was Hamas cannot be allowed to exist.

How does that fall within the way international law understands the kinds o=
f responses that are reasonable here? I think the view that the absolute de=
struction and extermination of your adversary is the war objective is simpl=
y grossly disproportionate and impermissible as a matter of jus ad bellum, =
which is to say the law governing resort to the use of force. Hamas does no=
t represent an existential threat to Israel. Israel is saying that our obje=
ctive in this war is to destroy all Hamas military presence, period. So the=
n it's basically an no holds barred situation because the argument is there=
 are tunnels underneath everywhere.

So the way that Israel is interpreting international humanitarian law here,=
 it's deliberate choice to prioritize military necessity over the principle=
s of proportionality and distinction, and also to describe military necessi=
ty with respect to its overall strategic objectives rather than answering t=
he question whether this object in this concrete and direct way is contribu=
ting to a specific military advantage in that moment, is reinterpreting the=
 rules in a way that undermine both the spirit and the law of international=
 humanitarian law because it eviscerates the law's ability to protect civil=
ians. What's made much more complicated is that Israel is not always clear =
in claiming that it's Hamas as a armed actor that must be destroyed. Oftent=
imes, it seems as if it's just Hamas as a whole, and Hamas has many differe=
nt characteristics. It is an armed faction in Gaza, but it is also the gove=
rning authority that represents all of the civil service, all of the bureau=
cracy, all of the municipal services, everything that enables any territory=
 to run from crossing guards to sanitation workers, to people who are opera=
ting the hospital systems. And so the idea of destroying the governing auth=
ority is totally impermissible and would be actually targeting of the civil=
ian infrastructure, which is indeed something I think we're seeing.

And so there's a troubling question of what does Israel how does Israel def=
ine the object that's seeking to eliminate or exterminate? And in the conte=
xt of Gaza, which is a very, very small territory with a very dense civilia=
n population, is going to have the kinds of consequences we've seen of just=
 grotesque disproportionate harm to civilians. Is this a place where intern=
ational law and what you might call international practice diverge? Because=
 it is difficult for me to imagine all that many countries suffering the ki=
nd of attack from a neighboring territory that Israel suffered and not beli=
eving their objective is to wipe out the governing authority that planned, =
financed, and launched that attack. I mean, the the obvious, I think, analo=
gy for Americans is Al Qaeda after 9/11 was certainly the way the American =
political establishment initially absorbed, you know, this moment.

Right? You know, Joe Biden kind of making the point of how many 9 elevens t=
his would feel like to Israel, even as many of us kind of really push the i=
dea that our response to 911 was misguided. But but it wasn't an effort to =
invoke that same sense of of how a country might reasonably be expected to =
respond to this kind of security risk. So there's a question of of internat=
ional law here, but there's also the question of what do countries typicall=
y do under this kind of pressure. And I wonder if those 2 diverge for you.

So it's an interesting question. To begin with, the idea of a country facin=
g an armed attack from another country and what does it do is, of course, t=
he premise of all of the laws of war. And, like, let's think of the context=
 of Ukraine and Russia, for example. We don't imagine a scenario in which i=
t's permissible for either of those actors to have as its war objective, th=
e complete elimination and extermination of all fighting forces and the gov=
erning structure of the other. We would understand that to be a kind of tot=
al war that's ruled out.

And if either party seemed like as if it was pursuing that kind of a maxima=
list goal, that would be rejected out of hand. So it really depends on wher=
e you sit. If you're the United States and you choose to see Hamas as the e=
quivalent of Al Qaeda 911, you might choose one set of repertoires. And as =
you say, international law required constraints that the United States did =
not observe post 911 and came to regret it for the reasons you were suggest=
ing. Many of us believe that the US response post 911 was disastrous, not o=
nly for those that were the targets of US force, but also for the United St=
ates itself, which in fact suggests that there is a purpose to the rules an=
d that enabling their constraining function may actually be in the interest=
 of all parties.

But if you're sitting elsewhere in the world, for example, in the global so=
uth, then you might not think of Hamas as similar to Al Qaeda, but rather t=
o the national liberation movement that achieved independence in your own c=
ountry. And the rest of the world, the global south at least, fought very h=
ard for a law that entrenched that right of armed resistance in the interna=
tional legal order through the additional protocols to the Geneva Conventio=
ns and through a range of subsequent customer international law that has gr=
own up around the Geneva Conventions and the additional protocols that reco=
gnize national liberation movements as a very different kind of actor, a so=
rt of proto state military rather than an actor that can be compared to Al =
Qaeda or, you know, terrorist group that isn't connected to a claim of nati=
onal self determination. I wanna go back to something you said a minute ago=
 about Russia and Ukraine because I actually did understand something like =
the governing authority of this country is illegitimate and a danger to us =
and needs to be wiped out completely as Russia's at least stated objective =
of what they were trying to do in Ukraine. And I think this gets to this qu=
estion somewhat of of enforcement where I think Russia's, you know, general=
 invasion was rejected within international law, and yet there is this kind=
 of shimmering crazy making sense around it where Russia did the thing that=
 is most abhorred under international law, just launched an invasion of a n=
eighboring country for functionally no reason whatsoever.

And yet Russia maintains its standing in the international system, as it ha=
s, you know, always been. It's sitting there on the UN Security Council. Th=
e fact that its, efforts have been rejected has not mattered all that much.=
 If we are looking at at the Russia Ukraine analogy alongside this, I do th=
ink that is one where people look at the system and they say, this is no sy=
stem at all, this is just power dressed up as laws, not laws that actually =
act to constrain power. In Russia and Ukraine, it's one thing to say that t=
he goals of Russia are to defeat the Ukrainian government and to perhaps re=
move the leadership of the Ukrainian government.

And it's another thing to say that the goal of Russia is to wipe them out a=
nd exterminate them. So I don't think we have any evidence to suggest at th=
is point that they have articulated an expectation, for example, of taking =
every person who has served in the Ukrainian government from trash collecto=
rs to sanitation workers to civilian crossing guards to policemen to k thro=
ugh 12 teachers, etcetera, and just kill them all. Is that Israel's goal, t=
hough? Because that's also to my I mean, I have a deep critique of the way =
Israel has conducted this war, but I don't hear them saying that every doct=
or who works for the Hamas government should be killed here. I mean, that t=
hat also sounds like beyond what Israel has described as their goal.

I was just pointing out that the goal of wiping out Hamas has the potential=
 to be read in 3 different ways. There's the armed actor, there's the gover=
ning infrastructure, and there's the social movement, and there's ambiguity=
 in the way that Israel describes it. More generally, Israel has targeted, =
for example, the police force, it has targeted civilian infrastructure of a=
 variety of kinds. So it's hard to say exactly what their goals are, but I =
didn't mean to assert that they had the goal of killing those people. I'm j=
ust saying if that were a goal, it would be impermissible.

That kind of total war would be impermissible under any circumstances in an=
y context, whether between states or with respect to a non state actor, etc=
etera. And that was the sense in which I was invoking Russia and Ukraine ea=
rlier in our conversation that we don't understand that to be the Russian w=
ar goal and the challenge that we have in saying that Israelis have establi=
shed the complete destruction and elimination of Hamas as the objective of =
the war raises troubling implications of total war that I think we wouldn't=
 permit in any context, even the suggestion of destroying the entire milita=
ry. I mean, for example, the United States clearly had in mind in its invas=
ion of Iraq and subsequent occupation of Iraq, destroying Saddam Hussein's =
capacity to wield his military. It didn't entail destroying every last figh=
ting man or fighting age man in Iraq. And indeed, it didn't involve even di=
sarming all Iraqis.

These are not the kinds of objectives that we have. Typically, it's a decap=
itation of the leadership and then a preservation to the extent possible of=
 infrastructure that will make governing the day after possible. It's not a=
lways clear in the case of the war against Hamas that Israel is making any =
of these distinctions. What are, in your view, the clearest violations of t=
he laws of war that have happened during Israel's invasion of Gaza? I think=
 the one that is probably the easiest to document and substantiate is the b=
locking of access to humanitarian aid and what is now amounting to the crim=
e of starvation.

Because Israel, the officials, declared in the immediate aftermath of Octob=
er 7th that they were gonna cut off all food, all fuel, all water, and have=
 proceeded to oversee, scheme in which they control, today, all points of e=
ntry and egress from Gaza, and have precluded humanitarian aid necessary fo=
r subsistence of the subsistence of the Ghazan population to enter the terr=
itory, and have also denied humanitarian actors the ability to supply that =
aid. So blocking humanitarian assistance, including food, medicine, fuel, w=
ater treatment, hospitals, that I think is the clearest and most easily est=
ablished war crime. I think the deliberate targeting in some instances or a=
t least indiscriminate bombardment of areas that have dense concentrations =
of civilians. It's difficult in the context of war crimes, as you know, and=
 the violations of international humanitarian law to establish the requisit=
e intent. But examples of indiscriminate killing that are well known includ=
e the killing of Israeli hostages when they were had escaped and were walki=
ng clearly unarmed with their hands up, carrying white flags, and were none=
theless executed.

And then the strike on the World Central Kitchen 4 car convoy. These are ca=
ses where because of the identity of those that were struck, Israel has fel=
t the need to explain its conduct and others have scrutinized the conduct, =
but I think these are very small examples of a much, much wider pattern. Un=
fortunately, the deaths of 34,000 plus Gazans has simply not attracted the =
same level of international focus. But there are statements that have been =
made on the record by Israeli military authorities and IDF spokespeople tog=
ether with the empirical record of enormous destruction of all civilian inf=
rastructure in Gaza that make it relatively more straightforward than in ot=
her context to establish that the war crime of indiscriminate bombardment o=
f civilian areas has occurred. There are, I think, 2 major categories here =
that I wanna think about, not separately, but for different reasons.

So one is the actions that I think it is fair to say are targeted at civili=
ans or at least indiscriminately truly indiscriminately targeted at civilia=
ns like the siege. And, I mean, that has always seemed to me to be a war cr=
ime and the sort of American defense of it has, I think, been disappointing=
. The other piece of it, which you brought up around these tunnels, what Is=
rael says is that Hamas is using international law against it. That Hamas u=
ses civilian shields. And I cannot judge whether this is true, but take it =
as plausible for the moment that, you know, Hamas works out of schools and =
and hospitals.

And the Israelis have said, well, because of that, it means that unfortunat=
ely, we have had to destroy, I mean, there's just a Times report on the hug=
e proportion of Gazan schools that have just been wrecked. And so, Israel's=
 argument is that this is not Israel's fault, it is Hamas's fault, that it =
is Hamas that has decided to hide among civilians and to use both civilians=
 and civilian infrastructure as shields, as disguises, as operating bases. =
And so the consequence of this falls on them. How does international law tr=
eat a question like that when you do have a force that at least to some deg=
ree is using civilians and civilian infrastructure as kind of shields, coll=
ateral damage and and operating basis? Obviously, in places and in territor=
ies where you have a dense civilian population, there is infrastructure tha=
t is helping an adversaries, armed forces, sustain itself on which the civi=
lian population is also deeply dependent.

Targeting that on the grounds that it's dual use is not only in violation o=
f the spirit of international humanitarian law and the goal of protecting c=
ivilians and minimizing harm to civilians in conflict. But in many cases, i=
t's also a violation of the rules, which brings us to human shields and tha=
t argument. So the definition of using human shields for a matter of intern=
ational law is the deliberate placement of civilians and proximity to milit=
ary objectives during a conflict. It's not the presence of civilians in den=
sely populated areas from which armed groups also operate. Gaza is a tiny t=
erritory, and inevitably, on a territory that small that has 2,300,000 peop=
le residing, you're going to have civilians close to places where Hamas ope=
rates no matter what.

Under those circumstances, the rules require that Israel take precautions t=
hat are available to take. So let's take an example of the hospitals. Let's=
 say, arguendo, that Hamas was using a hospital or was present underneath a=
 hospital, then what would be the measures that Israel is permitted to take=
 in order to address the tactical military advantage of an actual Hamas pre=
sence, an armed presence in that moment near or under that hospital. First =
of all, Israel would have to evacuate the civilians or create an opportunit=
y for the civilians that are in the hospital to be evacuated. It would have=
 to facilitate access to medical supplies and necessary humanitarian assist=
ance for patients to be transferred for patients in need of care.

It would also have to ascertain where it believes Hamas is present and narr=
owly target whatever strike or attack to that particular location. And it's=
 not simply that you warn a population of an attack, it's that you provide =
them a meaningful opportunity to be evacuated from an area. You offer them =
safe passage and you enable them to travel to somewhere where they will be =
safe. Instead, we've seen warnings without opportunities to evacuate or whe=
re evacuation passageways have themselves been the subject of targeting for=
 attack and where people have been directed to places that themselves have =
continued to be bombarded. Let's just look at the laws of war for a moment =
and see what they're designed to do.

They're not designed primarily for ex post accountability and, you know, to=
 be used in an international criminal setting. They're designed for ex anti=
 incorporation in the military manuals and books and rules that govern arme=
d forces, how they're trained and what they're told they can or can't do. N=
ow I think there's good reason to think that there has been a dramatic shif=
t in Israel in the internal rules of engagement. We're probably not gonna b=
e able to establish whether that's true or not in the immediate period beca=
use Israel will remain the most powerful actor on the ground and will not s=
ubject itself to that kind of third party inquiry. But the rules are failin=
g to constrain Israel 1st and foremost because Israel has ceased to interna=
lize those rules.

The use of such heavy weaponry as 2,000 pound bombs or the shelling with ve=
ry heavy artillery of civilian areas where civilian populations remain pres=
ent is quite distinctive in this context because it's happened so frequentl=
y and with such a high level of ordinance that sets it apart from essential=
ly any other conflict to date, at least that the United States has been inv=
olved with or implicated in. One thing that has been interesting to me is t=
he Biden administration has been shifting its position somewhat over the pa=
st, you know, I would call it 2 or 3 months, is that as much as internation=
al law has not been able to constrain Israel on its own. It is the tool the=
 Biden administration increasingly seems to be using as it looks for a way =
to reconcile its own positions. It wasn't there when they didn't want it to=
 be there. But when they don't seem to want their position to simply be Joe=
 Biden's had enough, he thinks they've gone too far, It does sort of operat=
e as this other language, this sort of agreed upon language.

I'm curious how you think about that sort of role of this, even where inter=
national law cannot work as an in the moment enforcement mechanism. It is s=
omething that can be used at times to create sort of mounting moral pressur=
e or justify decisions that would not otherwise work politically. Yeah. I m=
ean, I think that's clear. And again, I just wanna go back to where we star=
ted at the very beginning of our conversation in thinking about how does la=
w work as a general matter.

We don't say in a domestic system that has periodic surges and murder rates=
 that the law of homicide doesn't exist or doesn't work or is unenforceable=
. Even if it's the case that there are people that escape the capacity of t=
he law to actually hold them individually accountable for one reason or ano=
ther, The fact that people break the law and sometimes get away with it doe=
sn't mean the law doesn't exist and doesn't have force. The Biden administr=
ation came into office in part signaling at home and abroad that it was bre=
aking from the Trump administration, breaking from a period of what it view=
ed as lawless rule and returning to a rule based order, rehabilitating the =
US reputation. What we have now entered into is a period of a return of ser=
ious multipolarity. That is to say, the United States faces a range of acto=
rs, some larger, some smaller, that for a variety of reasons, either in the=
ir particular spheres of influence or globally have emerged as either adver=
saries or challengers.

And in this context, of course, each of them is able to make recourse to th=
e precedent set by the United States of failing to constrain when they want=
 to act. And so they'll point to Kosovo, they'll point to Iraq, they'll poi=
nt to Libya, and we're seeing the consequences of those precedents now when=
 they're wielded to legitimate uses of force we disagree with. So there is =
that phenomenon for starters, and that indicates a universe in which all ac=
tors, not just the United States, have to either be far more careful about =
the ways in which they continue to erode the existing international legal i=
nfrastructure, or in which we are moving in the direction of regional, frag=
mented interpretations of what the international rules are, powerful actors=
 commanding authority within their own near abroad, becoming stronger, and =
over time, the production of precisely the kinds of dynamics that resulted =
in the world wars of 20th century. So for much of the war, the US has used =
its veto at the Security Council to stop any resolutions calling for a ceas=
efire. Then in March, when another one came along, this one, written somewh=
at differently, the US abstained and allowed it to pass.

The Israelis ignored it. And then the US called it nonbinding. And there wa=
s a state department briefing where a reporter asked about this. So you don=
't believe anything is gonna happen as a result of the passage of this reso=
lution? So I think that separate and apart from this resolution, we have ac=
tive ongoing negotiations to try to achieve what this resolution calls for,=
 which is the, an immediate cease fire and the release of hostages.

I don't know. I can't say that this impact this resolution is gonna have an=
y impact on those negotiations. So I don't expect you to answer this now, b=
ut do you need to stick this in your pocket? If that's the case, what the h=
ell is the point of the UN or the UN Security Council? That was really a mo=
ment, I think, that made the contradictions in our relationship to internat=
ional law pretty stark.

There's actually a precedent for the United States treating a UN Security C=
ouncil resolution and turning around and presenting it as nonbinding. And s=
trikingly, it was in the South African context. You had a very similar situ=
ation during apartheid that we find ourselves in now in which the UN Genera=
l Assembly, the overwhelming majority of states in the international system=
 passed resolution after after resolution after resolution with enormous ma=
jorities in support of denunciations of the South African regime of aparthe=
id, calls for sanctions, arms embargoes, all kinds of things. In the genera=
l assembly, while it doesn't have the power to issue resolutions that have =
binding law, that are the force of binding law, it has enormous power to sh=
ape agendas. And it did do that even as the US and the UK, and to some exte=
nt, France continued to use their role in the security council to shield th=
e South African government, the general assembly ended up setting the globa=
l agenda for how one should understand South Africa.

And over time, the Security Council had no choice under enormous pressure t=
o finally agree to some very, very mild measures against South Africa. But =
the very first such resolution passed by the Security Council involved exac=
tly the same pattern. And then the US delegate turning around and saying, w=
ell, this is non binding and having an enormous debate about how to interpr=
et security council resolutions, etcetera. In the end, in the grand scheme =
of things, it just didn't matter because the overall momentum in the system=
 was against the South African government. And in the coming years after th=
at, South Africa had come to become such an illegitimate actor globally tha=
t the Security Council finally did pass binding resolutions involving arms =
embargoes.

And as we know, there was a eventual transition in South Africa to a post a=
partheid system. So this non binding resolution around the ceasefire could =
also be seen as the first in a series of steps that might occur in this rel=
ationship between international public opinion, international law, the gene=
ral assembly, international courts, the UN Security Council, that shift our=
 attention away from the long standing international humanitarian law frame=
work that has dominated and that has forced us to look specifically at the =
rules for belligerent occupation and the rules of the conduct of hostilitie=
s when Israel engages in a variety of kinds of operations against Gaza or a=
gainst the West Bank to shift our gaze from all of that and instead return =
our attention to the question of the entirety of the mandate and ask a ques=
tion about what the future would look like politically and legally under in=
ternational law for an authority that governs 14,000,000 people, where 7,00=
0,000 people, Jewish citizens, are fully enfranchised citizens of a democra=
cy, and the other population of the territory, the other 7,000,000 people s=
till have unresolved rights, and they're still sitting on the territory as =
well. And then always our final question.

What are 3 books you would recommend to the audience? Yeah. Thank you so mu=
ch for giving me a chance to recommend some great books. The first I would =
recommend is Anthony Enge's imperialism, sovereignty, and the making of int=
ernational law, which retells the history of international law as well as t=
he intellectual history of canonical European jurists by centering the colo=
nial encounter as the structuring event that triggered the emergence of int=
ernational law as we know it. I would also recommend Noora Erekat's Justice=
 for Some, Law and the Question of Palestine, which provides a detailed and=
 highly readable account of how international law first facilitated British=
 colonial rule, and then how it's been used by Israelis and Palestinians to=
 organize on the one hand and resist on the other.

I would also recommend Aidam Get to Choose World Making After Empire, The R=
ise and Fall of Self Determination, which returns to the era of decolonizat=
ion to offer an account of how the principle of self determination was diff=
erently understood by anti colonial leaders and how that understanding had =
it prevailed might have yielded alternatives to logics of partition, logics=
 like the logic that underlies the UN's involvement in, Israel Palestine an=
d ideas of the 2 state solution. And then with your indulgence, I'm gonna r=
ecommend a 4th book, Aziz Rana's The Constitutional Vine, how Americans cam=
e to idolize a document that fails them, which is a wonderful book just pub=
lished that provides an eye opening and beautifully rendered account of how=
 we as Americans came to be bound to a constitution that makes it so diffic=
ult to hold our own government accountable or to translate public preferenc=
es into changes in our policies. A question that I believe has renewed urge=
ncy at a time when polls show that consistent majorities in the United Stat=
es support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Azaabali, thank you very much. Th=
ank you.
