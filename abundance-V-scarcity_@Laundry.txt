[Speaker 1]
To climate Focus abundance organizations into Innovation and progress studies organizations into people who care about making government work better. And all of these different pieces of the community are finding each other at events like this at events that we've done in DC and in New York City at a huge conference that we had last October and the book that other Derek and Ezra came out with, I think was very much the spark that has really ignited this into something that.

Is much more powerful and profound, and it's just thrilling to see.

[Speaker 2]
I prepared several Derek Kaufman, Derek Thompson jokes, and uh, they have already been taken so. Um. Derek. Uh, before we get into business, who are you? How did you get into this? What is inclusive abundance and

[Speaker 1]
How to get started? So, I, uh, came to abundance after a 20-year career on Wall Street. Uh, where I work at JP Morgan in Citadel. I think that's on interest rates and currencies and mortgages. About a decade ago, I left that life and started to think about what I call policy philanthropy. So, how can you combine support for great think tanks, generating ideas, and connect those to public officials and their staff who are looking for ideas and organize community of donors and supporters who are interested in both the political giving side of the equation and the public policy research support side of the equation. Prototype that model on two different projects. The first was the child tax credit and changing it so that it could reach families in poverty. This was a project that spanned 2016 to 2021 when the American Rescue plan put this into place for a year, cutting child poverty almost in half.

[Speaker 3]
The other project

[Speaker 1]
I was excited about was thinking about the spatial inequity in our country and thinking about bringing opportunity to more places and one of the tools that that, as this kind of wonky thing called the regional technology and Innovation hubs, Regional Tech hubs for short that wound up becoming law in the chips and Science Act in 2022.

[Speaker 2]
Here in San Francisco now Derek.

[Speaker 1]
Both of these were abundance, but not of that name. And. Around the time when they became law was when Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson and Noah Smith and Matt Iglesias and Jerusalem Dempsis and many other thought leaders really began specking out what an abundance framework would be for solving America's problems. But we can talk more. I think about defining abundance later, but for me, it really resonated. And in 2023, I decided to start an organization to institutionalize and scale some of the projects that I had done in the other policy areas and created first, a 501c3, which is inclusive on its initiative. Last year, about a year ago, 501c4 lobbying and advocacy. Really bringing those ideas to public officials, and we've been building the community meeting. People who are doing the work connecting them. We've been supporting politicians in generating ideas, and we've been excited to see how much traction it's gotten.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, we are here, because, uh, Armand and I are with Gibby Democrats for America, and you'll be Democrats for America is here, because Armand founded yippies for Harris, uh, and led a ginormous like a 70 plus speaker. A fundraiser for Kamala Harris. Didn't just raise about 150, 000. It had more than 30, 000 live viewers. We had Governors, uh, Congress people centers. It was, uh, very cool. Um, and what we didn't know at the time, but as we started radio abundance recently, we interviewed a congressman, Scott Peters, who told us that the, uh, new bipartisan Congressional yippee caucus, uh? Five, our work, and specifically what our mind did that. What we did was to identify and by promote, just promoting the lead-up to the event. Identify how many people in Congress. We're yippies! How many people really cared about this that they cared about this, uh, and that they should come together to do something about it, and that there was a mobilized and engaged constituency, ready to support it, and what Congressman Scott Peters told us was that our virtual read room became a recruiting center, uh, as they started to build this, and I bring this up because recently, we launched as Jimmy Democrats from America, and we launched with a fairly bold Mission to defeat fascism and build America. So, I was very excited.

News and see that there was a brand new bipartisan Congressional build America caucus, and then I was emailing back and forth with Derek and Derek said, have you seen our news? And I said, I have seen the news, I thought they were pregnant, actually, but?

I didn't get that joke, but now I get it. I'm into it, um? I said, I haven't seen bad news. What the heck do you mean our news, uh? And Derek, I wonder if you tell us a little more?

[Speaker 1]
So, uh? As I mentioned, a lot of this project that inclusive abundance is interested in is organizing. The people who can affect policy change and connecting them to the ideas. And after the conference in October, it became clear, logical. Next Step would be to create a group in Congress where abundance and those kinds of ideas could be channeled to change how the company works. Had an old friend named JD Brom, who had been the executive director of the house new Democratic caucus, which is the largest ideological focus in the House of Representatives about a hundred moderate Dems. From 2012 to 2020, and then he worked for Gina Armando at Commerce doing chips implementation. And after the, uh, after that job ended, we retained him as a senior advisor to start coordinating among bipartisan members of Congress. This new vehicle? The the abundance? Movement was clearly animating what was happening, but I think an interesting question is how we keep abundance at the federal level bipartisan. I think it's great that you guys are doing this work in California. Is going to be Democrats, and clearly California is a very blue state where the fight within the Democratic party for abundance or scarcity is a huge driver. What kinds of outcomes you get? Better level for anything to be durable. It's going to have to be bipartisan, especially if it's going to achieve the 60 vote threshold to get over filibuster in the Senate. So, abundance because of the Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson's book, it says slightly left coded word, and at the same time, many of the principles that are sitting inside of abundance. Pretty ideologically ambiguous, and there's a lot of the ideas around cutting red tape and making it easier to build that come from the classical tradition of the right. But they achieve Progressive ends. And so we wanted to think about a way to make sure Republicans were. Uh, eager participants in this project and abundance caucus wasn't necessarily the way that that was going to happen. Uh, I personally wanted to call it the get you done. Caucus, and uh, I made the case, uh, we were sitting with the founding members of that caucus, who includes Scott Peters, who's who's amazing on a lot of these issues, uh, and Jake awfulclaws, who I think you've had? Representative Josh Carter, who's uh out in Stockton, and is the chair of this caucus, and we balance ideas around for the name and in the end, uh, abundance is also a word that's kind of an elite word right now. It's not a retail political work. What do we care about? We care about bringing costs down. We hear about making it easier to build and we care about U.S national security and build America. Caucus was a very simple, eloquent way to express those ideas, and so that's why we were that name. Although in the press release that that?

Day, where 15 members spoke, get stuff done was repeated by over half of them. So, I think in their minds, it is the get stuff done caucus with build America being the retail brand

[Speaker 2]
Here. Here I. Oh, uh, sure, everybody waiting for me, so politely, I want to bring out Armando in in a second, because I haven't yet, uh, I've done some quite good jokes, um, but? I, I did wanted to say you, you mentioned something really important, right, which is like, inclusive abundance is a non-partisan, bipartisan organization, uh, building to build those bridges and and get shit done, right? Um, and uh, and so, how have you been doing rats for America fits in. What's exciting to us, you know, the yimpy movement, uh, before the abundance movement has long been proudly nonpartisan and bipartisan as a way to find common ground break out of the partisan divide and overcome nimbies in both parties.

That are nonpartisan and bipartisan, like inclusive abundance, liking the action, uh, light abundance Network, um. Yeah, you've got it. Go do it, and that creates a little home for us to say. Hey, how can we compliment you by rallying Democrats, taking this message to progressives getting home for people who are giving these end Democrats. And, uh. Working together side by side with you. To make this happen all over America, you know, thank you. I think there

[Speaker 1]
Are really two parallel projects that are happening here. One is, how do you build an abundance faction within the Democratic party? I think that the Democrats could use an optimistic Vision about building an economic opportunity and a focus on getting shit done. Are surveyed about which party is to get you done party? It is not the Democrats right now. And we need to change that because it's really what the country wants. So? Supporting organizations that are working on the left to create abundance and fight scarcity. Is valuable to me and valuable to everyone in this room and an important part of the project. Bridge building, and when I put inclusive abundance together, the goal was for the abundance actually to be inclusive. I think that's like the obvious meaning, but for abundance to be ideologically transcendental to be ideologically inclusive and to build Bridges to the abundance. Republicans who exist, and they are fighting their own fight in the party right now against scarcity, factions, and Magna. And so, while we see some of the scarcity on the left, which can be the what Ezra Klein calls the Marin County liberals, The environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the natural resources defense Council, who are the number one litigants using NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act, blocking wind and solar projects, right? So, this is the left version of scarcity. The right. We see a lot of zero-sum mentality with respect to trade, putting tariffs on our allies. We see zero, some thinking around science funding. If you look the Loan program's office and Department of energy, which is a huge funder of all sorts of Next Generation, electricity is potentially going to have its funding cut in the current bill, so there's there's scarcity on the right and scarcity on the left, and there's abundance on the right, and there's abundance on the left and for the project to succeed federally. We're going to need to get the abundance people together to do stuff.

[Speaker 2]
I want to take a step back. Um,

[Speaker 4]
And

[Speaker 2]
Talk about sort of concept of abundance, because one thing that's great about tonight is, like, I think there's lots of people who've read the book get it are excited by it. But also at least personally, but a lot of people are like, I don't know what this stuff is. I was, like, come, come, please. You know, we're now in a moment where we talk about abundance. Ezra and Derek wrote this book. Well, what that means. It's like, Republicans, Democrats. It's very different. I'm curious about you, especially someone who came to, like, abundant stuff, I think earlier than a lot of people. Um, what did they mean to you? How do you define it, and how do you think of the movement as a whole? Yeah, it's.

[Speaker 1]
It's a really important question, um.

Uh, he said that he was worried that abundance was a capacious word. And, uh, this is why Derek Thompson has the number one New York Times bestseller and I built. It is a big word it can take on a lot of meanings and part of what's happening in the last couple of years. Is people are coming together to try to Define it, and it's really important to define the word because I actually think it's our North Star to navigate out of our current polarized dysfunctional political system. Fundamentally, abundance is the antithesis of scarcity. It is the opposite of scarcity is fighting scarcity and in the world. There's real scarcity. There is a scarcity of seeds in this room, and there are only so many people who can get chairs. You look in pack Heights, there's a 40 foot building limit, and the reason that there are not taller buildings there. Is not because of physics. It's because of policy. Right, and so this is self-imposed scarcity. This is scarcity that we have chosen to manufacture through our political system, and abundance is an analytical framework rather than just a word to identify and dismantle. That's all from post scarcity. Be effective. It needs to be more than just an analytical framework. It needs to be a political movement where it unites people. Across the ecosystem to implement the abundance policies and. Remove the scarcity policies. You know, uh,

[Speaker 2]
Speaking of chairs, is this on? Yeah, kind of, all right. Um, speaking of chairs, uh, you know, Armon, and I sat down and got to interview, uh, The Economist, Daryl fairweather for radio abundance recently, and she had a pretty incredible metaphor. I thought for the housing market, which, um? Game of musical chairs. Tim, everyone knows musical chairs, but you have a certain amount of chairs. Not going to clean it all, right? Yeah, you go around the chairs, there's like music, and uh, then everybody has to sit at a certain point and every round one chair goes. And you get smaller and smaller, and more people lose. And there's one final winner, and

[Speaker 3]
Uh

[Speaker 2]
Joe Fairweather, compared the housing market to a game of musical chairs, where if you find your chair if you want, you can keep it for the rest of the game, and not only that, but you can start removing chairs from the game so that other people can't have shares.

Play a game where you have one winner, but we don't want to play a game where we have one winner. We want to make all of us into winners. And it seems like if we want to make all of us into winners. We need to add more chairs so.

Oh sorry, I've got a Segway. Do you want to step on it? Is this important? All right. And what we're going to do right now is add more chairs. We have a bunch more panelists, um, please cheer and act at Muse, so it stalls an awkward moment while we add more chairs to.
